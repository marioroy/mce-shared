1.100 Sat Jun 18 16:30:00 EST 2016

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Use Sereal 3.008+ automatically if available on the box.

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Added support for cyclical include of MCE Hobo by scoping the
    configuration to the local package.

1.008 Wed May 25 22:00:00 EST 2016

  * Applied correction in META.json.
  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.707.

1.007 Wed May 25 16:00:00 EST 2016

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Added chunk IO capability to READ in MCE::Shared::Handle. Both non-shared
    and shared handles are supported. See documentation for demonstrations.

  * Added assign to MCE::Shared::{ Array, Hash, and Ordhash }. Ditto, added
    hassign and lassign to MCE::Shared::{ Minidb }. Assign is inspired by
    Tie::Hash::Indexed v0.05_02. Thank you, Marcus Holland-Moritz.

  * Added META.json to the distribution.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Close shared file-handles when stopping the shared-manager process.
  * Improved exporting for shared MCE::Shared::{ Array, Hash, and Ordhash }.

  * Now loads PDL::IO::Storable automatically when PDL is present. PDL must
    come before MCE::Shared. Otherwise, load PDL::IO::Storable manually.

  * Specifying Sereal for serialization falls back to Storable when PDL is
    present. A warning is emitted indicating Sereal is not used.

  [API CHANGES]

  * Removed iterator and rewind functionality from MCE::Shared::Minidb.
    This was done to streamline Minidb and MCE/Shared/Server.pm.
