  * Do not enable barrier mode for Queue if constructed inside a thread
    or for the fast => 1 option.

  * Fixed leaked handles during destruction; MCE::Shared::{ Condvar, Queue }.

  * Updated MCE::Shared to not croak when running Perl in taint mode via
    perl -T. Failing -T was MCE::Shared::{ Handle, Sequence, and Server }.

1.822 Sun Apr 02 23:00:00 EST 2017

  * Is now safe running MCE::Hobo with the Wx GUI toolkit (wxWidgets).
  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.826.

1.821 Sun Apr 02 07:00:00 EST 2017

  * Updated MCE::Shared::Queue. The following provides a comparison
    for the enhancements made regarding IPC during 1.818 through 1.821,
    in order to run on machines having "many" cores. I ran with 12, 96,
    and 192 workers on an 8 core box.

    Shared queue, dequeue 100k items.

       my $Q = MCE::Shared->queue();

       # Must start the manager manually when IO::FDPass is missing.
       # This caveat applies to Condvar, Handle, and Queue.

       MCE::Shared->start() unless $INC{'IO/FDPass.pm'};

       $Q->enqueue( 1 .. 100000 );
       $Q->end();

       MCE->new(
           max_workers => 12, 96, or 192,
           user_func   => sub {
               while ( defined ( my $item = $Q->dequeue ) ) {
                   ;
               }
           }
       )->run();

    MCE::Shared 1.821:  12 ~ 1.325 secs  96 ~ 5.206 secs  192 ~ 8.158 secs
    MCE::Shared 1.825:     ~ 0.913 secs     ~ 1.068 secs      ~ 1.560 secs

  * Results were captured on a fast 8 core system running CentOS Linux 7.
    The thing to take from this is that running many workers "no longer"
    results in up to 6.2x penalty regarding IPC.

  * When IO::FDPass is missing, croak with error if constructing a Condvar
    or Queue and forgotten to start the shared-manager process manually.

  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.825.

1.820 Sat Apr 01 01:00:00 EST 2017

  * Completed validation for running MCE on a box having 100+ cores.
  * Tuned the number of data-channels for IPC, similar to MCE.

  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.824.

1.819 Fri Mar 31 19:30:00 EST 2017

  * Calibrated the number of data-channels for IPC.

  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.823.

1.818 Fri Mar 31 11:00:00 EST 2017

  * Check for EINTR during sysread and syswrite.
  * Improved non-shared handles constructed with MCE::Shared::Handle.
  * Reap MCE::Hobo's from script exiting during development process.
  * Completed validation for using MCE::Shared with 200+ cores.

  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.822.

    https://github.com/marioroy/mce-examples/tree/master/network

  * Default to ':raw' for BINMODE in MCE::Shared::Handle.
  * Optimized 'dequeue' method in MCE::Shared::Queue.

  * Refactored MCE::Hobo to spawn children on the Windows platform.
    This is necessary for Mojo::IOLoop::HoboProcess to run properly,
    with Mojolicous 7.25 and later.

  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.821.

1.816 Mon Mar 06 13:00:00 EST 2017

  * Optimized SHIFT and UNSHIFT methods in MCE::Shared::Ordhash.

1.815 Fri Mar 03 23:00:00 EST 2017

  * Fixed issue with localizing AUTOFLUSH variable before autoflush handles.
    Thank you, Charles Hendry for raising the issue.

  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.819.

  * Fixed an issue in regards to deeply sharing an array or hash.

  * Changed Sereal to Sereal::Decoder and Sereal::Encoder in recommends
    section inside Makefile and META files.

  * Revised limitations section in documentation, in regards to not having
    IO::FDPass. E.g. Condvar, Handle, and Queue.

    Updated documentation on dequeue and pending.

  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.818.

1.813 Wed Feb 22 18:00:00 EST 2017

    Improved write performance by up to 8 percent.
    Fixed spelling mistakes.

  * Revised the description on posix_exit in MCE::Hobo.

1.812 Mon Feb 20 05:30:00 EST 2017

  * Improved performance for MCE::Shared::Cache.
    This is now a hybrid LRU-plain cache implementation.
    Added parallel demonstration at the end of the documentation.

  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.814 for the example to run.
  * Tweaked MCE::Shared::Ordhash and MCE::Shared::Server.

1.811 Wed Feb 15 17:00:00 EST 2017

  * Bumped IO::FDPass dependency to 1.2 if not already installed (1.1+)
    and have a CC compiler on hand. IO::FDPass is optional otherwise.

  * Support csh redirection in Makefile.PL via bash for locating a C compiler.

1.810 Tue Feb 14 17:00:00 EST 2017

  * Added recommends section to Makefile and META files: IO::FDPass, Sereal.
  * Added cross-platform template to MCE::Hobo for making an executable.

  * Added hobo_timeout option to MCE::Hobo for timeout capability.
    Also, imply posix_exit => 1 when Gearman::XS is present.

  * Added MCE::Hobo + Gearman demonstrations (xs and non-xs) on Github:
    https://github.com/marioroy/mce-examples/tree/master/gearman_xs
    https://github.com/marioroy/mce-examples/tree/master/gearman

  * Changed kilobytes and megabytes to kibiBytes (KiB) and mebiBytes (MiB)
    respectively inside the documentation.

  * Having IO::FDPass is beneficial for Condvar(s), Handle(s), and Queue(s).
    Thus, append IO::FDPass to PREREQ_PM if we can and not already installed.
    Run MCE_PREREQ_EXCLUDE_IO_FDPASS=1 perl Makefile.PL to bypass the check.

    This was missed in the 1.101 release.

1.101 Mon Jun 20 01:00:00 EST 2016

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Reverted a small change in Shared/Server.pm introduced in 1.100.

1.100 Sat Jun 18 16:30:00 EST 2016

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Use Sereal 3.008+ automatically if available on the box.

  [NEW FEATURES]

    configuration to the local package.

1.008 Wed May 25 22:00:00 EST 2016

  * Applied correction in META.json.

1.007 Wed May 25 16:00:00 EST 2016

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Added chunk IO capability to READ in MCE::Shared::Handle. Both non-shared
    and shared handles are supported. See documentation for demonstrations.

  * Added assign to MCE::Shared::{ Array, Hash, and Ordhash }. Ditto, added
    hassign and lassign to MCE::Shared::{ Minidb }. Assign is inspired by
    Tie::Hash::Indexed v0.05_02. Thank you, Marcus Holland-Moritz.

  * Added META.json to the distribution.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Close shared file-handles when stopping the shared-manager process.
  * Improved exporting for shared MCE::Shared::{ Array, Hash, and Ordhash }.

  * Now loads PDL::IO::Storable automatically when PDL is present. PDL must
    come before MCE::Shared. Otherwise, load PDL::IO::Storable manually.

  * Specifying Sereal for serialization falls back to Storable when PDL is
    present. A warning is emitted indicating Sereal is not used.

  [API CHANGES]

  * Removed iterator and rewind functionality from MCE::Shared::Minidb.
    This was done to streamline Minidb and MCE/Shared/Server.pm.

1.006 Fri Apr 29 21:30:00 EST 2016
