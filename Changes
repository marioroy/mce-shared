Revision history for Perl module MCE::Shared.

1.809 Thu Jan 26 14:00:00 EST 2017

  * Fixed bug in MCE::Shared::Queue (dequeue_nb) when queue has no data.

  * Having IO::FDPass is beneficial for Condvar(s), Handle(s), and Queue(s).
    Thus, adding IO::FDPass to PREREQ_PM if we can and not already installed.
    Run MCE_PREREQ_EXCLUDE_IO_FDPASS=1 perl Makefile.PL to bypass the check.

  * Added hobo_timeout option to MCE::Hobo for timeout capability.
    Auto-imply posix_exit => 1 if Gearman::XS is present.

1.808 Fri Dec 09 23:30:00 EST 2016

1.805 Fri Sep 23 01:00:00 EST 2016

    Bumped version to match MCE version.

  * Completed work supporting cyclical include of MCE Hobo.
  * Updated MCE::Shared to support Perl included with Git Bash.

    This was missed in the 1.101 release.

1.101 Mon Jun 20 01:00:00 EST 2016

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Reverted a small change in Shared/Server.pm introduced in 1.100.

1.100 Sat Jun 18 16:30:00 EST 2016

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Use Sereal 3.008+ automatically if available on the box.

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Added support for cyclical include of MCE Hobo by scoping the
    configuration to the local package.

1.008 Wed May 25 22:00:00 EST 2016

  * Applied correction in META.json.
  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.707.

1.007 Wed May 25 16:00:00 EST 2016

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Added chunk IO capability to READ in MCE::Shared::Handle. Both non-shared
    and shared handles are supported. See documentation for demonstrations.

  * Added assign to MCE::Shared::{ Array, Hash, and Ordhash }. Ditto, added
    hassign and lassign to MCE::Shared::{ Minidb }. Assign is inspired by
    Tie::Hash::Indexed v0.05_02. Thank you, Marcus Holland-Moritz.

  * Added META.json to the distribution.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Close shared file-handles when stopping the shared-manager process.
  * Improved exporting for shared MCE::Shared::{ Array, Hash, and Ordhash }.

  * Now loads PDL::IO::Storable automatically when PDL is present. PDL must
    come before MCE::Shared. Otherwise, load PDL::IO::Storable manually.

  * Specifying Sereal for serialization falls back to Storable when PDL is
    present. A warning is emitted indicating Sereal is not used.

  [API CHANGES]

  * Removed iterator and rewind functionality from MCE::Shared::Minidb.
    This was done to streamline Minidb and MCE/Shared/Server.pm.

1.006 Fri Apr 29 21:30:00 EST 2016
