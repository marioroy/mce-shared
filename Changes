Revision history for Perl module MCE::Shared.

1.815 Fri Mar 03 05:00:00 EST 2017

  * Do not localize AUTOFLUSH variable before autoflush file handles.
    Thank you, Charles Hendry for raising the issue.

1.814 Wed Mar 01 22:00:00 EST 2017

  * Fixed an issue in regards to deeply sharing an array or hash.

  * Replaced Sereal with Sereal::Decoder and Sereal::Encoder in Makefile,
    inside recommends section. Ditto for META files.

  * Revised limitations section in documentation, in regards to not having
    IO::FDPass. E.g. Condvar, Handle, and Queue.

  * Added 'end' method to MCE::Shared::Queue.
    Updated documentation on dequeue and pending.

  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.818.

1.813 Wed Feb 22 18:00:00 EST 2017

  * Revised the main description in MCE::Shared::Cache.
    Improved write performance by up to 8 percent.
    Fixed spelling mistakes.

  * Revised the description on posix_exit in MCE::Hobo.

1.812 Mon Feb 20 05:30:00 EST 2017

  * Improved performance for MCE::Shared::Cache.
    This is now a hybrid LRU-plain cache implementation.
    Added parallel demonstration at the end of the documentation.

  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.814 for the example to run.
  * Tweaked MCE::Shared::Ordhash and MCE::Shared::Server.

1.811 Wed Feb 15 17:00:00 EST 2017

  * Bumped IO::FDPass dependency to 1.2 if not already installed (1.1+)
    and have a CC compiler on hand. IO::FDPass is optional otherwise.

  * Support csh redirection in Makefile.PL via bash for locating a C compiler.

1.810 Tue Feb 14 17:00:00 EST 2017

  * Bumped minimum requirement for Sereal to 3.015 when available.
    Added check ensuring matching version for Encoder and Decoder.

1.809 Mon Feb 13 23:30:00 EST 2017

  * Fixed bug in MCE::Shared::Queue (dequeue_nb) when queue has zero items.
  * Applied small optimization in MCE::Shared::Sequence.

  * Added MCE::Shared::Cache, a fast and memory-efficient LRU-cache module.
  * Added pipeline methods to MCE::Shared::Array, Hash, Minidb, and Ordhash.
  * Added recommends section to Makefile and META files: IO::FDPass, Sereal.
  * Added cross-platform template to MCE::Hobo for making an executable.

  * Added hobo_timeout option to MCE::Hobo for timeout capability.
    Also, imply posix_exit => 1 when Gearman::XS is present.

  * Added MCE::Hobo + Gearman demonstrations (xs and non-xs) on Github:
    https://github.com/marioroy/mce-examples/tree/master/gearman_xs
    https://github.com/marioroy/mce-examples/tree/master/gearman

  * Changed kilobytes and megabytes to kibiBytes (KiB) and mebiBytes (MiB)
    respectively inside the documentation.

  * Having IO::FDPass is beneficial for Condvar(s), Handle(s), and Queue(s).
    Thus, append IO::FDPass to PREREQ_PM if we can and not already installed.
    Run MCE_PREREQ_EXCLUDE_IO_FDPASS=1 perl Makefile.PL to bypass the check.

  * Improved documentation for QUERY STRING in various helper classes.
  * Updated SYNOPSIS in various helper classes.
  * Updated LOCKING section in MCE::Shared.

1.805 Fri Sep 23 01:00:00 EST 2016

  * Re-enabled Sereal 3.008+ for Perl < v5.12.0, if available.
  * Optimized dequeue methods in MCE::Shared::Server.

1.802 Mon Jul 04 03:30:00 EST 2016

1.801 Sun Jul 03 00:30:00 EST 2016

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Fixed bug with MCE::Hobo for the Solaris platform.
  * Fixed race condition in Condvar->broadcast, ->signal, ->wait.
  * Fixed race condition in Queue->await.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * MCE::Shared 1.801 is stable on all supported platforms.
    Bumped version to match MCE version.

  * Completed work supporting cyclical include of MCE Hobo.
  * Updated MCE::Shared to support Perl included with Git Bash.

1.102 Mon Jun 20 08:00:00 EST 2016

  * Updated logic for obtaining caller in several MCE::Hobo methods.
    This was missed in the 1.101 release.

1.101 Mon Jun 20 01:00:00 EST 2016

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Reverted a small change in Shared/Server.pm introduced in 1.100.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Use Sereal 3.008+ automatically if available on the box.

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Added support for cyclical include of MCE Hobo by scoping the
    configuration to the local package.

1.008 Wed May 25 22:00:00 EST 2016

  * Applied correction in META.json.
  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.707.

1.007 Wed May 25 16:00:00 EST 2016

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Added chunk IO capability to READ in MCE::Shared::Handle. Both non-shared
    and shared handles are supported. See documentation for demonstrations.

  * Added assign to MCE::Shared::{ Array, Hash, and Ordhash }. Ditto, added
    hassign and lassign to MCE::Shared::{ Minidb }. Assign is inspired by
    Tie::Hash::Indexed v0.05_02. Thank you, Marcus Holland-Moritz.

  * Added META.json to the distribution.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Close shared file-handles when stopping the shared-manager process.
  * Improved exporting for shared MCE::Shared::{ Array, Hash, and Ordhash }.

  * Now loads PDL::IO::Storable automatically when PDL is present. PDL must
    come before MCE::Shared. Otherwise, load PDL::IO::Storable manually.

  * Specifying Sereal for serialization falls back to Storable when PDL is
    present. A warning is emitted indicating Sereal is not used.

  [API CHANGES]

  * Removed iterator and rewind functionality from MCE::Shared::Minidb.
    This was done to streamline Minidb and MCE/Shared/Server.pm.

1.006 Fri Apr 29 21:30:00 EST 2016
